# DCC-GARCH Model Implementation

This folder contains scripts for estimating a Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) GARCH model on multivariate financial returns data. The implementation uses the `mgarch` package for model fitting and produces various outputs for model evaluation and comparison.

## Scripts Overview

1. **00_run_dcc_estimation.py**: Wrapper script that runs the entire estimation process and tracks total execution time.
2. **01_univariate_garch.py**: (Not used in current workflow) Previously used for first-stage univariate GARCH estimation.
3. **02_dcc_fit.py**: Fits the DCC-GARCH model to the original returns data and saves model outputs.
4. **03_in_sample_metrics.py**: Calculates in-sample metrics and performs diagnostic tests.
5. **04_forecast_gmv.py**: Forecasts Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio weights.

## Data Outputs

The implementation produces the following outputs:

## Key Model Parameters

- **a** (DCC parameter): Controls the impact of past standardized shocks on current correlations
- **b** (DCC parameter): Controls the persistence of correlations
- **dof** (Degrees of freedom): Parameter of the multivariate t-distribution

## Notes on Implementation

- The implementation directly uses original returns as input to the DCC model
- Numerical stability measures are implemented for log-likelihood calculation
- The model uses a multivariate t-distribution to account for fat tails
- Correlation matrices are stored in 3D format (T,N,N) rather than reshaped to 2D (T,N*N)

## Usage for Model Comparison

When comparing this DCC-GARCH model with other models (e.g., DFSV-BIF, DFSV-PF, Factor-CV), the following outputs are particularly relevant:

1. **Log-likelihood**: For comparing fit to data (higher is better)
2. **Number of parameters**: For assessing model complexity
3. **AIC/BIC**: For comparing models with different numbers of parameters
4. **Estimation time**: For comparing computational efficiency
5. **Standardized residuals**: For diagnostic tests and residual analysis
6. **Conditional covariance matrices**: For comparing volatility and correlation dynamics
7. **GMV weights**: For comparing portfolio allocation implications

The outputs are structured to facilitate direct comparison with other models using the same metrics.
