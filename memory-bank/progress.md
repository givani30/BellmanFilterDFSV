## Completed Tasks

*   [2025-04-01 01:06:39] - Initialized Memory Bank.
*   [2025-04-01 01:11:45] - Analyzed code structure (`src/`, `core/filters/bellman.py`, `models/dfsv.py`, `core/filters/particle.py`).
*   [2025-04-01 01:11:45] - Documented initial system patterns in `systemPatterns.md`.
*   [2025-04-01 01:31:38] - Refactored `scripts/simulation_study.py` (Phase 1) for config/raw output & fixed NumPy 2.0 compatibility. Tested refactoring.
*   [2025-04-01 02:47:00] - Debugged Bellman filter: Fixed low log-volatility correlation (identified prior dominance due to small `Q_h`, increased `Q_h` scaling, corrected `Q_f` prediction), fixed `ConcretizationTypeError`.
*   [2025-04-01 03:37:00] - Refactored `DFSVParticleFilter` to accept parameters externally for JIT compatibility.
*   [2025-04-01 04:21:00] - Completed Particle Filter refactoring and launched expanded simulation study.
*   [2025-04-01 05:13:00] - Optimized particle filter likelihood calculation for diagonal `R_t`.
*   [2025-04-01 05:13:00] - Benchmarked particle filter with `float32` vs `float64`.
*   [2025-04-01 11:28:32] - Implemented resume capability for `scripts/simulation_study.py`.
*   [2025-04-01 12:05:00] - Optimized Bellman filter performance using Woodbury Identity and Rank-1 FIM reformulation. Verified with profiling and tests.
*   [2025-04-01 12:22:00] - Profiled particle filter performance and tested minor optimizations (vectorized likelihood, covariance calculation).
*   [2025-04-01 21:59:14] - Cleaned up and consolidated all Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`).

## Current Tasks

*   [2025-04-02 20:37:16] - Implement the Bellman Information Filter (`DFSVBellmanInformationFilter`) in `src/bellman_filter_dfsv/core/filters/bellman_information.py` according to the specification in `bif_implementation_plan.md`.

## Next Steps

*   Test the BIF implementation thoroughly.
*   Re-run optimization examples (`examples/bf_optimization.py`) using BIF to confirm stability.
*   Update simulation study (`scripts/simulation_study.py`) to use BIF.
*   Re-evaluate the need for Cloud Batch simulation runs based on BIF performance.
*   Analyze simulation results (Plan: `simulation_analysis_plan.md`).
*   Implement hyperparameter estimation framework using BIF pseudo-likelihood.

*   [2025-04-01 21:59:14] - Merged duplicate sections, updated task statuses based on cross-file review, and removed simple log entries during Memory Bank cleanup.
*   [2025-04-02 00:17:00] - Updated status: Memory leak investigation completed and resolved by switching from `filter_scan` to `filter`.
*   [2025-04-02 19:57:00] - Updated status: Debugging of original Bellman filter stopped due to numerical instability.
*   [2025-04-02 20:27:00] - Updated status: Planning for Bellman Information Filter (BIF) completed.

*   [2025-04-02 23:26:45] - Completed implementation of `DFSVBellmanInformationFilter` in `src/bellman_filter_dfsv/core/filters/bellman_information.py` (Plan Steps 1-10).

*   [2025-04-02 23:26:45] - Added helper methods `get_predicted_covariances`, `get_predicted_variances`, `get_filtered_covariances`, `get_filtered_variances` to `DFSVBellmanInformationFilter`.

*   [2025-04-02 23:26:45] - Created and passed initial unit tests (10 tests) for `DFSVBellmanInformationFilter` in `tests/test_bellman_information.py` (Plan Step 11).
*   [2025-04-02 20:35:28] - Updated status: Memory Bank updated with context from Lange (2024) and Boekestijn (2025).
*   [2025-04-02 20:37:16] - Updated Current Tasks and Next Steps to reflect focus on BIF implementation. Removed redundant/outdated task/step entries.
