## Completed Tasks
*   [2025-04-01 01:06:39] - Initialized Memory Bank.
*   [2025-04-01 01:11:45] - Analyzed code structure (`src/`, `core/filters/bellman.py`, `models/dfsv.py`, `core/filters/particle.py`).
*   [2025-04-01 01:11:45] - Documented initial system patterns in `systemPatterns.md`.
*   [2025-04-01 01:31:38] - Refactored `scripts/simulation_study.py` (Phase 1) for config/raw output & fixed NumPy 2.0 compatibility. Tested refactoring.
*   [2025-04-01 02:47:00] - Debugged Bellman filter: Fixed low log-volatility correlation (identified prior dominance due to small `Q_h`, increased `Q_h` scaling, corrected `Q_f` prediction), fixed `ConcretizationTypeError`.
*   [2025-04-01 03:37:00] - Refactored `DFSVParticleFilter` to accept parameters externally for JIT compatibility.
*   [2025-04-01 04:21:00] - Completed Particle Filter refactoring and launched expanded simulation study.
*   [2025-04-01 05:13:00] - Optimized particle filter likelihood calculation for diagonal `R_t`.
*   [2025-04-01 05:13:00] - Benchmarked particle filter with `float32` vs `float64`.
*   [2025-04-01 11:28:32] - Implemented resume capability for `scripts/simulation_study.py`.
*   [2025-04-01 12:05:00] - Optimized Bellman filter performance using Woodbury Identity and Rank-1 FIM reformulation. Verified with profiling and tests.
*   [2025-04-01 12:22:00] - Profiled particle filter performance and tested minor optimizations (vectorized likelihood, covariance calculation).
*   [2025-04-01 21:59:14] - Cleaned up and consolidated all Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`).
*   [2025-04-02 23:26:45] - Implemented and tested `DFSVBellmanInformationFilter` (BIF) in `src/bellman_filter_dfsv/core/filters/bellman_information.py` and `tests/test_bellman_information.py`. Added covariance/variance getter methods.
*   [2025-04-04 16:59:00] - Investigated BIF optimization stability (`scripts/bif_optimizer_stability.py`). Identified state explosion (`h`) issue and the stabilizing effect of priors (esp. `sigma2`).
*   [2025-04-04 17:55:28] - Completed implementation of prior framework in `src/bellman_filter_dfsv/core/likelihood.py` (updated `log_prior_density` and objective functions).
*   [2025-04-04 21:56:00] - Executed and analyzed BIF prior/optimizer comparison (`scripts/test_bif_priors_optimizers.py` with RMS norm, 500 steps). Found priors stabilize but slow convergence.
*   [2025-04-04 22:36:00] - Modified `scripts/test_bif_priors_optimizers.py` to save final parameters.
*   [2025-04-04 22:36:00] - Re-ran BIF prior/optimizer test to generate parameter `.pkl` files.
*   [2025-04-04 22:36:00] - Compared estimated vs true parameters from BIF test.
*   [2025-04-05 14:54:00] - Debugged BIF instability with true parameters (`debug_bif_true_params.py`), pinpointing failure origin to update step t=24.

*   [2025-04-05 16:02:00] - Debugged and fixed BIF numerical instability with true parameters by implementing eigenvalue clipping for `J_observed` (Expected FIM) in update step.

*   [2025-04-05 22:45:00] - Completed `src` directory cleanup: Revived and updated `bellman.py` (covariance-based filter) using BIF pseudo-likelihood (Lange Eq. 40), refactored helpers (`_bellman_impl.py`, `_bellman_optim.py`), improved documentation, removed dead code, and updated/passed relevant tests (`test_bellman_unified.py`).
*   [2025-04-05 23:05:00] - Executed full test suite (`uv run pytest`) after `src` cleanup, revealing 10 errors and 2 failures (related to `bellman_information.py`, `particle.py`, `transformations.py`).
*   [2025-04-05 23:05:00] - Debugged and fixed test failures: Corrected `jit` static argument usage, cast scalar return types, updated test expectations. Confirmed `uv run pytest` passes completely.


*   [2025-04-06 00:01:00] - Completed JIT refactoring of filter implementations (`bellman_information.py`, `_bellman_impl.py`, `bellman.py`, `particle.py`) per `jit_refactoring_plan.md`. Removed Python control flow from JIT paths. Tests pass (41/42, one known intermittent PF failure).

*   [2025-04-06 03:45:00] - Standardized test framework on `pytest`.
*   [2025-04-06 03:45:00] - Created common fixtures (`params_fixture`, `data_fixture`, `filter_instances_fixture`) in `tests/conftest.py`.
*   [2025-04-06 03:45:00] - Implemented unified tests for filter stability and log-likelihood in `tests/test_unified_filters.py`.
*   [2025-04-06 03:45:00] - Refactored `test_bellman.py`, `test_particle_filter.py`, `test_transformations.py` to use `pytest` and common fixtures, removing redundant tests.
*   [2025-04-06 03:45:00] - Added constraint verification tests (`test_untransformed_parameter_properties`) to `tests/test_transformations.py`.
*   [2025-04-06 03:45:00] - Debugged and fixed 5 test failures identified after refactoring.

*   [2025-04-06 14:20:00] - Executed Bellman Information Filter (BIF) simulation runs.
