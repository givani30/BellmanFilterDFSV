## Current Tasks
*   [07-04-2025 23:28:15] - Debug BIF (`bellman_information.py`) prediction/update steps due to inaccurate predicted covariances blocking EM plan.

*   Analyze BIF Simulation Results (Known Params) & Comparative Analysis (Thesis Plan v3.4 - Phase 2a, Task 6).
*   Design Hyperparameter Estimation Study Configurations (Thesis Plan v3.4 - Phase 2b, Task 7).


## Completed Tasks
*   [01-04-2025 01:06:39] - Initialized Memory Bank.

*   [01-04-2025 02:47:00] - Debugged Bellman filter: Fixed low log-volatility correlation (identified prior dominance due to small `Q_h`, increased `Q_h` scaling, corrected `Q_f` prediction), fixed `ConcretizationTypeError`.
*   [01-04-2025 03:37:00] - Refactored `DFSVParticleFilter` to accept parameters externally for JIT compatibility.
*   [01-04-2025 04:21:00] - Completed Particle Filter refactoring and launched expanded simulation study.
